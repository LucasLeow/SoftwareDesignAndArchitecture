### Agile Manifesto

Values & principles to help in creating better quality software

### 1. (Individual and Interactions) OVER (processes and tools)

- corporation used to value processes & models
- Agile says people & team more important to success than following process & models

### 2. (Working Software) OVER (Comprehensive documentation)

- As software constantly evolve, documentation will become obsolete
- updating comprehensive documentation can be tedious
- code itself can serve as documentation

### 3. (Customer Collaboration) OVER (Contract negotiation)

- software cannot be ordered
- not all requirements can be thought off-the-bat
- successful software involve customer feedback over time

### 4. (Responding to change) OVER (Following a detailed plan)

- requirements will keep changing over time
- responding to change will lead to higher chance of success
