## 1. Lean Startup

- methodology for developing businesses & products
- shorter development cycles
- discover if proposed business model is viable

#### 1.1 Business-Hypothesis-Driven Experimentation

#### 1.2 Iterative Product Releases

#### 1.3 Validated Learning

## 2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- version of product with just enough features to be usable by early customers
- to get early feedbacks for product viability & future improvements
- early release = avoid lengthy, unnecessary work
- Client interaction with product is more important than asking for their thoughts on it
- gain understanding on customer interest on product
- spend less effort & cost if product not viable

## 3. User Stories

- requirements are gathered as user stories in Agile model
- Dev team discuss with product owner / clients on requirements
- Dev team divide work and converts requirements into user stories
- Each user story should contribute to value of overall product
- Each story will have **User Acceptance Criteria** and should meet it 100% before story can be closed
  <br>
  > ### Creating User stories (Templates):
  >
  > ###1. Role-Action-Benefit (most common)
  > As a \<Role>, I want to perform \<Action> so that I can \<Benefit>
  > eg: As a \<Bank Customer>, I want to \<withdraw money from ATM> so that \<I am not constrained by opening hours or queues at banks>
  >
  > ### INVEST guidelines
  >
  > #### Independent
  >
  > - each user story should be independent
  >
  > #### Negotiable
  >
  > - user stories are not detailed contracts
  > - scope can be negotiated
  >
  > #### Valuable
  >
  > - every story should add value to product
  >
  > #### Estimable
  >
  > - story written is a way understandable to dev
  > - dev have idea on how to implement & how long it will take
  > - properly sized story
  >
  > #### Testable
  >
  > - stories should be testable to help determine if a story is completed or not
  > - should have valid acceptance criteria (objective, specific, testable, measurable)
  >
  > ### CCC (Card, Conversation, Confirmation)

## 4. Burndown chart

- graph of work left to do vs time
- y-axis = work left to do
- x-axis = time
- typically used with Scrum but can actually be used with any project to track progress over time
- work left can be in terms of:
  - story points
  - number of stories
- Number of workdays, workers & efficiency factor of worker also required
- Time required for project = [(Number of workdays) / (num of workers)] / worker efficiency
