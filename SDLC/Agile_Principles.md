### 12 Agile Principles

Provide guidance in resolving issues faced when using Agile methodology

#### 1. Satisfy customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

- deliver early & often
- delivery MVP within first few weeks
- continue delivering system by increasing functionality every 2 weeks

#### 2. Allow changing requirements, even late in development

- Agile methodology uses change to increase customer's competitive advantage
- see change as good thing

#### 3. Deliver working software frequently

- from a few weeks to a few months
- preference to shorter timescale

#### 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout project

- collaboration between customer, developers and stakeholders
- software must be continuously guided and built

#### 5. Build projects around motivated individuals

- provide the required support & environment
- trust in getting job done

#### 6. Face-to-Face conversation is most effective

- Agile does not have written plans / designs / specs / email
- conversations is primary mode of communication

#### 7. Working software is primary measure of progress

- progress not measured by phases / documentation produced
- 10% work done == 10% necessary functionality working as expected

#### 8. Agile processes promotes sustainable development. All parties should be able to maintain constant pace indefinitely

- like a marathon, fast but with sustainable pace
- not run fast early and burnout later

#### 9. Technical excellence and good design enhances agility

- high quality == high speed
- build high quality code initially, not messy code and cleanup in future

#### 10. Simplicity is key

- don't think about tomorrow's problem
- solve current problem with high quality

#### 11. Best architectures, requirements, designs emerge from self-organizing teams

- team will decide together on architecture, requirements and designs
- documents will not be handed externally to team

#### 12. Team reflects on how to become more effective at regular intervals

- environment is continuously changing, Agile team must change together
