# Software Design And Architecture

## Description

Watching countless programming courses is insufficient. Many people call it stuck in "Tutorial Hell". The solution? Build your own project. However, one should not simply get their "hands-dirty" and begin a project randomly. This can lead to messy design and bad practices in code.

Proper software development design and planning is crucial in the journey of programming. Thus, this repo was created to dump all the software project design and architecture learning and for all self projects to follow this planning guideline.
